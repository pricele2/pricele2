- 👋 Hi, I’m @pricele2
- 👀 I’m interested in data for civic engagement, for open government data, especially for public education specifically (early childhood through secondary), and just for fun (nerrrrrd)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new skills at an intermediate level of R / RStudio, especially for ETL and in-house projects for data governance   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other folks working in K-12 (or EE-14, etc.) data spaces 
- 📫 Find me here
